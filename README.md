## HTML Grabber
HTML Grabber is a lil script I made that grabs the victims IP when they open a html file and sends their geolocation details to a discord webhook.

When using this tool, make sure that your webhook is valid to avoid any error.

## How to use
1. Open the `webhook.bat` file. It will ask you for your [Discord webhook](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/how-to-get-started-with-discord-webhooks#conclusion) so just paste it in there
2. Once you've done that, you'll see a `payload.html` file in the folder directory. This is what the victim will open
3. Enjoy!
